##Questions
* How/why does github exist for free?
* Are we going to cover more sass stuff?

##Terminal Commands

* **cd** - think 'change directory:' change the current working directory. Remember that ~ is a special symbol that always represents your "home" directory.
* **ls** - think 'list:' shows a list of all files/folders in the current directory. With the -a flag, also shows hidden files and folders.
* **mkdir** - think 'make directory:' creates a new directory with the specified name.
* **touch** - updates the "last modified" timestamp on a file to now. Also creates an empty file if the filename specified doesn't exist.
* **mv** - think 'move:' moves a file or directory to a new location. This also makes it a convenient way to rename files and folders.
* **rm** - think 'remove:' deletes the file(s)/folder(s) specified.

##Git Gommands

* Use **git --version** to find out if Git is installed
* **git config** - allows you to make configuration changes to Git. With the --global flag, makes these changes available across your entire system.
* **git init** git init [projectName] - initializes a new repository. If projectName is provided, it creates a new project directory with that name. If not, it initializes a repository in the current directory.
* **git add** - adds files to the repository so that Git knows to track their changes.
* **git commit** - commits all added files to the repository as a change. With the -a flag, commits all changes to all tracked files. With the -m flag, allows you to specify a commit message directly on the command line instead of in your default editor.
* **git status** - show the current status of the git repository, including if there are ay uncommitted changes and whether or not any of our changes have been put in the staging area.
